Code challenge for So you want to learn to code 3.4

Inherit some very interesting code from a former employee and reworked it to get it running and readable.

purchase_tickets contains the subfunctions charge, dispense_ticket, and remove_seat
refund_tickets contains add_funds, remove_ticket, and add_seat.

It is only necessary to use purchase_tickets and refund_tickets. The subfunctions should not be necessary on their own.

This program also offers a print_movie_data function to return data from a movie library.
In addition, print_customer_data does the same for a customer library.

NOTE: movies.py does not contain a customer database. movies_test.py has an example of how you should format your libraries for this program.
